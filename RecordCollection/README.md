Setup and Workflow

1) On a 1 to 10 scale, I would rate my abilities with SQL database an 8. I have been practicing more and more and that makes me feel confident about my abilities. I gave myself an 8 because I also know there is always something new to learn and I am just scratching the surface of SQL databases.

2) I would first check the basic things like what is the language or what are the languages used in the codebase and what is the general purpose of the code that I can see with a glance at the code. Then I would check for any README instructions and code comments that would give me a deeper insight. Then if I still cannot understand the code, I would both dive deep into the code myslef and ask any senior developer available or supervisor about the codebase.
